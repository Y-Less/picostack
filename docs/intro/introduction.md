title: The Pico Stack Project
---

This project is a collection of software, carefully curated and assembled in
such a way that anyone can deploy a modern, secure and easy to use stack on a
single or collection of virtual or physical servers.

## Ideology

The project follows a simple set of ideas that apply throughout both the choice
and development of software:

### 1. Simple

The Pico Stack is what you reach for when Kubernetes is overkill. It's a small
collection of tools that do one job well.

### 2. Containerised

Everything must be containerised. It vastly simplifies the deployment,
maintenance and mobility of services. It provides a unified way of configuring,
monitoring and managing services.

### 3. Git-Ops and Infrastructure-As-Code

Your infrastructure is just as important as your code. So why not treat it that
way? The Pico Stack encourages and implements these two ideas wherever possible.

### 4. Automated

Whatever can be automated, should be. But things should also be easy to
intervene when things go wrong. Because things always go wrong!

### 5. Transparent

It should be easy to see what's happening. This means logging and metrics.
Alerts should be optional, but easy to set up.
