This guide will walk you through a simple standalone Pico deployment that does
not use a secret store for credentials. This is not recommended for production
use if you want to securely pass credentials to services such as databases or
API servers.

## Deploy Pico

The first step is to get a running Pico instance using the example configuration
stored in
[this repository](https://github.com/picostack/pico-example-config-no-auth).

### Fork The Examples

Now, to properly demonstrate how Pico works with GitOps/IaC, go ahead and fork
the
[config repository](https://github.com/picostack/pico-example-config-no-auth)
and the [target repository](https://github.com/picostack/pico-example-target)
and clone these to your computer.

### Replace `picostack` With Your Username

Open up the file `main.js` inside the _config repo_ and replace the `url`
property with your fork:

```js {3}
T({
  name: "pico-test-one",
  url: "https://github.com/picostack/pico-example-target",
  up: ["docker-compose", "up"],
  down: ["docker-compose", "down"],
});
```

Commit the change and push, now you're ready to deploy!

Now from here on, anywhere in the documentation and configuration files that
references the URL
`https://github.com/_YOUR_USERNAME_/pico-example-config-no-auth`, replace
`_YOUR_USERNAME_` with your own GitHub username.

### Deploy

<Tabs
  defaultValue="container"
  values={[
    { label: 'In Container', value: 'container', },
    { label: 'On Host OS', value: 'host', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="container">

### As Container

Make a new folder for this guide then grab this `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
version: "3"

services:
  pico:
    image: picostack/pico
    command: run https://github.com/_YOUR_USERNAME_/pico-example-config-no-auth
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ./cache:/cache
```

And run:

```
docker-compose up
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="host">

### On Host OS

If you have a Bash shell available:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/picostack/pico/master/install.sh | bash
```

Otherwise, download a binary from the
[releases page](https://github.com/picostack/pico/releases).

Then run:

```
pico run https://github.com/_YOUR_USERNAME_/pico-example-config-no-auth
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now you have a running instance of Pico, you should see the following in your
terminal:

:::note

If you deployed Pico with Docker Compose, your output will look slightly
different to the example below since it will be prefixed with `pico_1 |`.

:::

```
{"level":"info","ts":"2020-04-05T16:26:35.067Z","caller":"pico/main.go:96","msg":"service initialised"}
Creating pico-test-one_hello_1 ... done
Attaching to pico-test-one_hello_1
hello_1  |
hello_1  | Hello from Docker!
hello_1  | This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
hello_1  |
hello_1  | To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
hello_1  |  1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
hello_1  |  2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
hello_1  |     (amd64)
hello_1  |  3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
hello_1  |     executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
hello_1  |  4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
hello_1  |     to your terminal.
hello_1  |
hello_1  | To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
hello_1  |  $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
hello_1  |
hello_1  | Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
hello_1  |  https://hub.docker.com/
hello_1  |
hello_1  | For more examples and ideas, visit:
hello_1  |  https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
hello_1  |
pico-test-one_hello_1 exited with code 0
```

Congratulations! You just:

1. Started Pico
2. Told Pico to read configuration files from a repository
3. Watched Pico pull a [target](../reference/target) and execute
   `docker-compose up` inside it

## Update the Target

Leave Pico running in the background - it's designed to be left to its own
devices while you push commits.

What you did above was pull your fork of the Pico config example. This example
contained a single target, that lives at
`https://github.com/_YOUR_USERNAME_/pico-example-target` so now it's time to
push a change to this repository and watch Pico react to it.

This repository already has a branch named `merge-me` that contains a small
change to demonstrate this.

Open up the `pico-example-target` directory in your favourite terminal or editor
and merge the branch named `merge-me` into `master`:

```
‚ùØ git merge merge-me
Updating b4a745c..4bf7184
Fast-forward
 docker-compose.yml | 3 ++-
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

If you open up `docker-compose.yml` you'll notice the `hello` service has
changed:

```yaml {5,6}
version: "3"

services:
  hello:
    image: busybox
    command: echo "Hello from the Busybox container!"
```

This merge swapped out the image from `hello-world` to `busybox` and added a
command that prints to the console.

Commit this change to master and push. Switch back to the terminal where you
started Pico and you'll see some new output shortly:

```
pico-test-one_hello_1 exited with code 0
Recreating pico-test-one_hello_1 ... done
Attaching to pico-test-one_hello_1
hello_1  | Hello from the Busybox container!
pico-test-one_hello_1 exited with code 0
```

Pico pulled the new commit and ran `docker-compose up`. Docker Compose then did
the rest by diffing against the new Compose configuration, stopping the old
`hello-world` container and starting a new `busybox` container with the greeting
message.

And of course you can `git revert HEAD` and roll back to the old configuration.

## Update the Config

Now you can update the configuration in your fork of the config repo.

Open up the `main.js` file and duplicate the target a couple of times, be sure
to give them unique names:

```js {8-20}
T({
  name: "pico-test-one",
  url: "https://github.com/picostack/pico-example-target",
  up: ["docker-compose", "up"],
  down: ["docker-compose", "down"],
});

T({
  name: "pico-test-two",
  url: "https://github.com/picostack/pico-example-target",
  up: ["docker-compose", "up"],
  down: ["docker-compose", "down"],
});

T({
  name: "pico-test-three",
  url: "https://github.com/picostack/pico-example-target",
  up: ["docker-compose", "up"],
  down: ["docker-compose", "down"],
});
```

Push this and you'll see Pico spawn two more targets.

Play around adding and removing targets, you can use any project you want, it
doesn't need to use Docker Compose.

## Conclusion

This example demonstrated a simple automation setup for applications deployed
with Docker Compose. Replace the hello-world example with a full application and
Pico allows you to automatically update configuration variables, image versions,
volume mounts etc. simply by pushing them to Git.

On top of this, you can then apply Git branching strategies and a review process
to your configuration files. This is usually referred to as GitOps or
Infrastructure-as-Code.
